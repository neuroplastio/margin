		Use:   "update [commit]",
		Short: "Replace this margin with the newest build from its release channel",
		Long: `margin update fetches the newest build of margin from the dev channel on
pkg.neuroplast.io, checks it against the release key built into this margin
(the signature over the build's manifest, then the binary's sha256), and puts
it in place of the margin you ran — following symlinks to the real file,
written beside it and renamed over it.

A commit (full, or its first few characters) installs that build instead,
older ones included, as long as the channel still holds it.

A local build (built from a checkout, on no channel) updates to the dev
channel's newest build; margin says what it replaced. If this margin's
directory is not writable by you, update refuses: install margin somewhere
you own, such as ~/.local/bin.

A margin that margin-launcher started (a package's margin) installs the
build into ~/.local/margin instead, and the next margin you start runs it.

The server and the key are built into margin; nothing moves them.`,
